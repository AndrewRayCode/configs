hg-prompt
=========

hg-prompt adds an 'hg prompt' command to Mercurial for viewing repository information.  It's designed to be used in a shell prompt.


Requirements
------------

hg-prompt requires Python 2.5+ and (obviously) Mercurial.


Installing
----------

Clone the repository:

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/sjl/hg-prompt/

Edit the `[extensions]` section in your `~/.hgrc` file:

    [extensions]
    prompt = (path to)/hg-prompt/prompt.py


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for hg-prompt is at the [project page][project].  There's a [Quick Start guide][quickstart], [Full Usage Guide][usage], [Keyword List][keywords], and a few other things there.

The documentation is stored in the `docs/` directory of the repository if you prefer to read it offline.

Questions, Comments, Suggestions
--------------------------------

The code was kind of thrown together in a few nights after I got tired of chaining three or four hg runs together to get what I wanted.  I'm sure it's not perfect, so if you've got a way to improve it please add an issue and let me know.

Patches are also welcome!
