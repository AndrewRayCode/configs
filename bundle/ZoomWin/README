Note: version 23 or later of ZoomWin requires vim 7.2 or later

Usage:

    Press <c-w>o : the current window zooms into a full screen
    Press <c-w>o again: the previous set of windows is restored

Features:

The idea is to make it easy to zoom into and out of a window.  ZoomWin supports normal windows, and it now also supports scratch-windows, no-name windows, and modified-buffer windows.

 * ZoomWin is a 7.2 plugin (as of v23)

 * Files are made hidden during zoom-in and restored upon zoom-out

 * All windows' file contents will be restored during zoomouts. 

 * ZoomWin will clean up any temporary files it generates upon exit.
 
 * Session files are guaranteed to be unique to each vim session, so multiple vims can use zoom-in/out without interfering with one another

A later version may be available at http://mysite.verizon.net/astronaut/vim/index.html#ZOOMWIN .

When zooming in, ZoomWin's window is full sized, with no loss of screen space to status lines for other windows, unlike vimscript#1280 (ToggleOnly), for those vims compiled with the +mksession feature.  For those vims without that feature, v21 ZoomWin now supports partial-zoom-in (leaves a status line behind for each window).

History:

Ron Aaron came up with the original ZoomWin and gave permission to have it posted.
