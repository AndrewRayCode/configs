- When disabling Narrowing using :NRN and one quits the buffer,
  should the highlighting be removed? (it doesn't yet)

- I really need some tests, like:
  * Visual Narrowing
  * Narrowing 1 Region
  * Narrowing several independent regions with setting the g:nrrw_rgn_protect
    variable
  * Multi line narrowing
