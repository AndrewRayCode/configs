DESCRIPTION					  *CompleteHelper-description*

Via 'completefunc' and the |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U| command, it is possible to define
custom |complete-functions|. To write extensions or alternatives to the
built-in completion functions, you often need to derive the completion
candidates from Vim's buffers and windows. This plugin offers generic
functions around extraction and handling of completion matches (something that
Vim doesn't yet expose to Vimscript), so that building your own custom
completion is quick and simple.

SEE ALSO								     *

The following custom completions use this plugin:

AlphaComplete:		Completes any sequence of alphabetic characters.

BidiComplete:		Considers text before AND AFTER the cursor.

CamelCaseComplete:	Expands CamelCaseWords and underscore_words based on
(vimscript #3915)	anchor characters for each word fragment.

CustomKeywordComplete:	Expands keywords from a sequence of contained
			characters.

LongestComplete:	Completes based on the longest possible text before
			the cursor.

MinLengthComplete:	Only offers completions that add more than n
			characters.

MotionComplete:		Completes a text chunk determined by {motion} or text
			object.

MultiWordComplete:	Completes a sequence of words based on anchor
			characters for each word.

PatternComplete:	Completes matches of queried {pattern} or last search
			pattern.

PrevInsertComplete:	Recall and insert mode completion for previously
(vimscript #4185)	inserted text.

RegisterComplete:	Completes register contents.

SameFiletypeComplete:	Completion from buffers with the same filetype.
(vimscript #4242)

WORDComplete:	    	Completes an entire sequence of non-blank characters.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*CompleteHelper-usage*

This plugin defines several functions. The following is an overview; you'll
find the details directly in the implementation files in the .vim/autoload/
directory.

CompleteHelper#FindMatches( matches, pattern, options )

The main helper functions that finds all matches of a:pattern in buffers
specified by a:options, and returns them in the List a:matches that can be
returned as-is to Vim.


CompleteHelper#ExtractText( startPos, endPos, matchObj )

Low-level function for extracting text from the current buffer. This is the
default extractor used by CompleteHelper#FindMatches().


CompleteHelper#Abbreviate#Word( matchObj )

Processes the match objects to make them prettier to display. Usually
|map()|ed over the matches returned from CompleteHelper#FindMatches().


CompleteHelper#JoinMultiline( text )

Can be used in CompleteHelper#FindMatches()'s a:options.processor if you want
to flatten multi-line matches, as the current default behavior of Vim is not
what users expect. (Newlines are inserted literally as ^@.)


CompleteHelper#Repeat#TestForRepeat()

Some built-in completions support the repetition of a completion, so that
subsequent words from the completion source are appended. This function allows
to implement such a repetition for custom completions, too.

==============================================================================
EXAMPLE						      *CompleteHelper-example*

Here is a simple completion that completes the keywords in front of the cursor
from the current file, like the built-in |compl-current| does. From the
completion base, it constructs a regexp matching all keywords that start with
the base, and delegates the entire work of finding the matches and building
the appropriate match objects to CompleteHelper#FindMatches().
>
    function! SimpleComplete( findstart, base )
	if a:findstart
	    " Locate the start of the keyword.
	    let l:startCol = searchpos('\k*\%#', 'bn', line('.'))[1]
	    if l:startCol == 0
		let l:startCol = col('.')
	    endif
	    return l:startCol - 1 " Return byte index, not column.
	else
	    " Find matches starting with a:base.
	    let l:matches = []
	    call CompleteHelper#FindMatches( l:matches, '\V\<' . escape(a:base, '\') . '\k\+', {'complete': '.'} )
	    return l:matches
	endif
    endfunction

INSTALLATION					 *CompleteHelper-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vmb.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim CompleteHelper*.vmb.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					 *CompleteHelper-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					  *CompleteHelper-limitations*

- Only the '.' (current buffer), 'w' (other windows), and 'b' (other listed
  buffers) values (the last one with limitations) of 'complete'
  are currently implemented.
- As the searched buffers need to be either displayed in a
  window and jumped around for text extraction, or the buffer contents
  searched line by line, this doesn't scale well in Vimscript. I would wish
  for a built-in Vim function that does this (and supports all values of
  'complete').

KNOWN PROBLEMS				       *CompleteHelper-known-problems*

TODO							 *CompleteHelper-todo*

IDEAS							*CompleteHelper-ideas*

==============================================================================
HISTORY						      *CompleteHelper-history*

1.30	27-Sep-2012
- ENH: Allow skipping of buffers via new a:options.bufferPredicate Funcref.
- Optimization: Skip search in other windows where there's only one that got
  searched already by s:FindMatchesInCurrentWindow().
- Optimization: Only visit window when its buffer wasn't already searched.

1.20	03-Sep-2012 (unreleased)
- ENH: Implement a:options.complete = 'b' (only supporting single-line matches and no a:options.extractor).
- Transparently handle 'autochdir': still show the correct relative path in
  matches from other windows, and restore the buffer's CWD even if it was
  temporarily changed.

1.11	03-Sep-2012
- Make a:matchObj in CompleteHelper#ExtractText() optional; it's not used
  there, anyway. This avoids having to pass an empty dictionary just to
  satisfy the API.
- Introduce a:alreadySearchedBuffers to allow for swapped order in
  a:options.complete and to prepare for additional complete options.

1.10	05-May-2012
- Factor out CompleteHelper#Abbreviate#Text() to allow processing of
  completion menu text (and other uses), too.
- ENH: Offer full completion word in the preview window when it is shown
  abbreviated. Clients get this automatically when using
  CompleteHelper#Abbreviate#Word().

1.00	31-Jan-2012
First published version.

0.01	13-Aug-2008
Started development.
