# Usage

    ]he<motion>

Converts characters included in the motion to html entity form. It will convert
to the proper entity name, for example `&` becomes `&amp;`. If no entity is
found, it will use the number version, as in `'` becomes `&#39;`.

# TODO

Reverse the transformation, make work in other modes
