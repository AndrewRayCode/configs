extradite.vim
=============
A git commit browser / git log wrapper that extends fugitive.vim.

`:Extradite` toggles the Extradite buffer, i.e. the commit browser. By
default, it opens in the current window. Adding |!| makes it open in a vertical
split instead. The width of the split is set with `g:extradite_width`.

Note: `:Extradite` only runs if the current file is under git version control!

Once we are in the Extradite buffer, the following keymaps are available:

`<CR>` edits the revision on the current line in a fugitive-buffer.

`oh`, `ov`, and `ot` edit the revision under the cursor in a new horizontal
split / vertical split / tab respectively.

`dh`, `dv`, and `dt` diff the current file against the revision under the
cursor in a new horizontal split / vertical split / tab respectively.

`t` toggles the visibility of the file diff buffer.

`q` closes the Extradite buffer.

This plugin can also be obtained from [vim.org][1].
