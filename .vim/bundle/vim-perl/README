This is the aggregation of all the various Perl-related syntax and
helper files for Perl 5 and Perl 6.

For now, to install just do a "make install" and you'll get the
.vim files all installed in your ~/.vim directory.  It should do more than that, and probably use the Perl installation tools, but I'm not there yet.
