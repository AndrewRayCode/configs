# Vim mode in bash with cursor improvements. Zsh has different instructions
# First upgrade to Bash 4 on OSX http://clubmate.fi/upgrade-to-bash-4-in-mac-os-x/
# Then add the following lines to your ~/.inputrc:

# Turn on vim mode in bash (and other CLIs, like postgres!). Doesn't work for
# node, ruby, but works for python
set editing-mode vi

# Show the current mode (insert/command) in the bash prompt
set show-mode-in-prompt on

# Cursor options:
#    0 -> blinking block.
#    1 -> blinking block (default).
#    2 -> steady block.
#    3 -> blinking underline.
#    4 -> steady underline.
#    5 -> blinking bar (xterm).
#    6 -> steady bar (xterm).
# Bash colors: https://misc.flogisoft.com/bash/tip_colors_and_formatting

# Set the cursor and prompt prefix for insert and command mode.
# Explanation:
#    \1\e[    Some nonense escape code
#    6        The option from above
#     q\2     (with leading space) more nonense escape code
# I removed the following because it messes up line wrapping
#    \e[91m   The color of the thing to show in front of prompt (light red)
#    i        The text to put in front of the cursor
#    \e[0m    Reset color code (to be a good citizen)
